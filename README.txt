Share your Secrets is a clone of Whisper app where a user can share their 
secrets, feelings and stories anonymously without any need to reveal their 
faces or identity. 

The user has to create an account and the login details are stored in a MongoDB
database.

For authentication and security, passwords are encrytped using an npm package
called mongoose-encryption.
